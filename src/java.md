[^1]: It's hard to choose a specific course since there's plenty of training material available on the web, so just pick one and make sure that you really understand the topics mentioned below. If in doubt, try with the video lectures ([1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-programming-java) + [2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-algorithms-theory-machines)) of the book [Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/home/) by Wayne and Sedgewick.

[^2]: There's a number of [IDEs](https://www.tutorialworks.com/java-ide/) available for Java in this day and age, but my personal preference goes to Visual Studio Code as the ideal programming environment for polyglot developers: just to mention some features, VSCode allows you to [open a remote folder on any remote machine, virtual machine, or container with a running SSH server](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) (also integrating nicely with [WSL](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl)), [visualize data structures](https://addyosmani.com/blog/visualize-data-structures-vscode/) while debugging and can run in a lightweight version in a [web browser](https://vscode.dev/) without installing anything.
